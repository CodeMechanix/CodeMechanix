As 2+ years experienced backend java developer, I’ve developed and led many mission-critical projects from scratch to deployment by following Scrum methodology and using CI/CD and java 8/java 11/python. As a software engineer with decent knowledge in SOLID principles, Java, Python, MySQL, PostgreSQL, Docker, Redis, I am confident enough to help a team to design and build a great efficient scalable microservice system.

I was involved in competitive programming during my B.Sc. life. I have participated in 15+ national & international programming contests along with ACM-ICPC regional three times. I was also quite active in online programming contests.

I have solved around 700+ programming problems in different online judges. This practice has given me great efficiency in data structures and algorithms.
